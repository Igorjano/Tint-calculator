# Tint Calculator for CABO Manual Tinting Machine

This is a Tkinter-based GUI application for calculating values to mix paint with color on a manual tinting machine. The program allows users to enter the number of tints, the amount of base dose per tint, and the total volume of paint, then calculates and displays the required dosages.
I wrote it for my work and it made my tinting process so much easier.

## Features

- Enter the number of tints and their respective dosages for 1 liter (or kg).
- Calculate the total dosage for a specified volume of paint.
- Display results in different units (Ounce 384 or Ounce Y/48/384).
- Clear inputs and results to start a new calculation.
